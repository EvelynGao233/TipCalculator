# TipCalculator

# Introduction

This is my first app built in Xcode.

With this iOS tip calculator, users are able to switch between light and dark themes and also reset the amount value. 

In my CodePath prework app, I have built a few features, but it's incomplete. In the future, I will continue to implement settings functionality.
